## Differences from `postman-to-openapi`

There are some small differences between this library and the [postman-to-openapi](https://npm.im/postman-to-openapi) upstream:

* Does not ship with a CLI component.
* Has protections in place to prevent `undefined` statuses from being set.
* Has no `version` property on the exported method to determine which version you're running as this is unnecessary without a CLI component.
